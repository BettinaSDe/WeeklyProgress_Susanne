Week 19 Feb to 25 Feb 2018:

Re-submitted my revised first Animal Trading Card project to the reviewer on 19 Feb 2018. 

I noticed that it is now really, really getting time to tackle responsive design, since I had a hard time to make the margins and the content padding fit for a "centered" button in a flush right-oriented <div>. I really want to learn more about how width: 100%; margin: auto; work together. I think this is what the next lesson will be about.
  
 Updated my GitHub account with this mentor-repository - excellent idea, thanks!
 
 Started a joint HEALTH project cross-track FEND and Android. The knowledge level of participants is entry-level to intermediate, enthusiam is high. Shared Google collaborative file with this collaborative group (we are 8 scholars now). 
 
 Initialized a weekly Meet-up in Zurich, Switzerland for this Friday (23 Feb) to start. 
 
 Will now start the lessons on Responsive web development. Can't wait to learn more about auto-margins and the emulgators (device-browser simulation). Chrome Canary also has a Performance test, but that's at advanced level. 
 
 Will update this file. 
 
 Best, Susanne
