Week 18 - 25 March 2018: I finally completed the first part of this Nanodegree "Web Foundations" and will use this week to work on my second project "Portfolio Project". For the Portfolio Project I will likely post a lot of questions in the live help on Slack. The next Friday I will be at a Health Hackathon where we program an application to be used by patients who wenter a clinic for a rehabilitation. This will also be very interesting. 


Week 12 - 18 March 2018: 
I started a freelance job in a web agency in addition to my regular job. We did some website improvement on a website in the web agency with adding self-produced Youtube videos to the relaunched website. 

Week 05 March to 11 March 2018: 

I want to learn lessons 14 - 17 of the Web Foundations. In parallel I start the project 2: PortfolioSite. 
I am wondering if I should learn that grid structure that I have to apply to this project via 
https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp
or if this is covered in the course, because I have never heard about it so far. 
I will surely have 2 revision rounds for Project 2, so this is likely keeping me busy for the next 2 - 3 weeks. 



Week 26 Feb to 03 March 2018: 

My first PROJECT (Animal Trading Card) was approved on 24 Feb 2018 with an excellent review. This Review  also contained links to learn more about writing the CSS even more elegant. I want to study those over the next few weeks. 
I made progress on the lessons. I am now at Lesson 13 - 6 ("Building up"). 
What I liked was the take -home re website CONTENT: You have to start with little content (key messages), since a majority of your users might load the page with their mobile. 
I also enjoyed the quiz about making the "Brighton News" mobile friendly (one column - relative width of 100 % ; 1.5em padding around tap-items. 

Today, I am re-writing my CV (Resume) for career purposes. I am glad that I have a GitHub Profile now which I can add to my profile. 
Where can I have my CV (Resume) reviewed - maybe in 1 - 2 months from now? 

My plan is also to set up the specifications for the SECOND PROJECT on my GitHub : PORTFOLIO SITE. 

Any idea what I should modify on this Week plan? Thanks, Susanne 


Week 19 Feb to 25 Feb 2018:

Re-submitted my revised first Animal Trading Card project to the reviewer on 19 Feb 2018. 

I noticed that it is now really, really getting time to tackle responsive design, since I had a hard time to make the margins and the content padding fit for a "centered" button in a flush right-oriented <div>. I really want to learn more about how width: 100%; margin: auto; work together. I think this is what the next lesson will be about.
  
 Updated my GitHub account with this mentor-repository - excellent idea, thanks!
 
 Started a joint HEALTH project cross-track FEND and Android. The knowledge level of participants is entry-level to intermediate, enthusiam is high. Shared Google collaborative file with this collaborative group (we are 8 scholars now). 
 
 Initialized a weekly Meet-up in Zurich, Switzerland for this Friday (23 Feb) to start. 
 
 Will now start the lessons on Responsive web development. Can't wait to learn more about auto-margins and the emulgators (device-browser simulation). Chrome Canary also has a Performance test, but that's at advanced level. 
 
 Will update this file. 
 
 Best, Susanne
